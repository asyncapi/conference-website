h5 Talk abstract

p In the new Internet of Things (IoT) era, our everyday objects have evolved in the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS). The use and deployment of CPS has especially penetrated the industry, giving rise to the Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT (IIoT). Typically, architectures in IIot environments are distributed and asynchronous, communication being guided by events such as the publication of (and corresponding subscription to) messages.
p In this talk, we present AsyncAPI toolkit, our proposal relying on AsyncAPI to automate the design and implementation of these architectures using model-based techniques. AsyncAPI toolkit provides a set of editors and Eclipse-based tools which allow defining JSON-based specifications of message-driven APIs using AsyncAPI. From these specifications, the prototype is able to generate the Java code supporting the creation and serialization of JSON-based message payloads according to the modeled AsyncAPI, including nested JSON objects, as well as the necessary code to publish and subscribe to different topics. The initial prototype that implements this proposal as an open-source project is available at <a href="https://github.com/SOM-Research/asyncapi-toolkit" target="_blank" style="display: inline;">https://github.com/SOM-Research/asyncapi-toolkit</a>.

p Abel Gómez is a researcher of the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, a research center of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, Spain. Previously, he has hold different positions at the Universidad de Zaragoza, the École des Mines de Nantes & Inria, and the Universitat Politècnica de València; being this latter institution where he obtained his PhD degree in Computer Science.
p His research interests fall in the broad field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), and his research lines have evolved in two complementary directions: on the one hand, the development of core technologies to support MDE activities; and on the other hand, the application of MDE techniques to solve Software Engineering problems.
